NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Upload::Audio::File - Get an Audio::File from an
    upload

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/Upload::Audio::File/;

        if ( my $upload = $c->request->upload('file_to_upload') ) {
            # The destination file must have the file extension intact
            my $temp_file = "/tmp".$upload->filename;

            # The new file location must be reflected into the $upload object
            $upload->copy_to($temp_file);
            $upload->filename($temp_file);

            print "Got a file of length ".$upload->length."\n";
            print "The bitrate is ".$upload->bitrate."\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Extends "Catalyst::Request::Upload" with "Audio::File".

WARNING
    Because `Catalyst::Request::Upload->filename` contains the name of the
    file as the user uploaded it and -not- the name of a real file on disk,
    and because `$upload->tempname` is a random string with no file
    extension, you must copy the file with the file extension intact and
    reflect the new file location back into the $upload object as
    demonstrated in the Synopsis.
